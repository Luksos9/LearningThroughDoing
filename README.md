# LearningThroughDoing

Some projects,games etc That i wrote to develop my coding skills.

## What i Learned?

#### PatternMatchingWIthRegularExpressions

I learned much about matching patterns. Their usefulnes and utilization. Wrote some programs to solidify knowledge about them, which can be found inside directory in this repository.

#### inputValidation

This is very useful module that i'm considering using any time i am prompting user for an input. It allows me quickly specify what user to input and what isn't desired. Some programs may be found in directory inside this repository.

#### smallGames

Few short games that use some things that learned and wanted to solidify by writting something fun. Solidified things like directories, loops, if's, random and many more.

#### someSimplePrograms

Also solidification of things that i lernt by writting programs.

#### usefulPrograms

Programs that i found useful and may use in future. There are programs like sending email if i wanted to automate this,formatting text or using wrappers to create a password.
