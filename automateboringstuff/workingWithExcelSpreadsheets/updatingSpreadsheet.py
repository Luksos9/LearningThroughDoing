"""Ideas to similiar programs:
*Read data from one spreadsheet and write it to parts of other spreadsheets.
*Read data from websites, text files, or the clipboard and write it to a spreadsheet.
*Automatically “clean up” data in spreadsheets. For example, it could use regular expressions to read
multiple formats of phone numbers and edit them to a single, standard format."""
